# Full Stack Bloglist App

This repository is used for the CI/CD module of my Fullstackopen course

- This is made for:

  - Monorepo for both frontend and backend.
    - Used Webpack Bundler for frontend components.
  - Implementation of CI/CD Workflow using `Github Actions`, in reference to [this](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part11/expanding_further).
  - Deployment of built app to [fly.io](https://fly.io/).
  - Reference repos (won't be maintained after this one works):
    - [Backend](https://github.com/micypac/fullstackopen22/tree/main/part4/blog_list)
    - [Frontend](https://github.com/micypac/fullstackopen22/tree/main/part5/bloglist-frontend)
